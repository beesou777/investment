        When you start investing on your own, the world of investing may seem
        wide, often too wide. But you can simplify things with some time-tested
        strategies. These popular investment choices can help you achieve a
        variety of financial goals, and help set you up for a lifetime of
        financial security.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        Here are five popular investment strategies for beginners, along with
        some of their advantages and risks.
      </p>

      <h2 class="py-4">Top investment strategies for beginners</h2>
      <p class="py-4">
        A good investment strategy minimizes your risks while optimizing your
        potential returns. But with any strategy, it’s vital to remember that
        you can lose money in the short run if you’re investing in market-based
        securities such as stocks and bonds. A good investment strategy often
        takes time to work and should not be considered a “get rich quick”
        scheme. So it’s important to begin investing with realistic expectations
        of what you can and can’t achieve.
      </p>
      <h2 class="py-4">1. Buy and hold</h2>
      <p class="py-4">
        A buy-and-hold strategy is a classic that’s proven itself over and over.
        With this strategy you do exactly what the name suggests: you buy an
        investment and then hold it indefinitely. Ideally, you’ll never sell the
        investment, but you should look to own it for at least three to five
        years.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Advantages: </span> The buy-and-hold strategy
        focuses you on the long term and thinking like an owner, so you avoid
        the active trading that hurts the returns of most investors. Your
        success depends on how the underlying business performs over time. And
        this is how you can ultimately find the stock market’s biggest winners
        and possibly earn hundreds of times your original investment.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        The beauty of this approach is that if you commit to never selling, then
        you don’t ever have to think about it again. If you never sell, you’ll
        avoid capital gains taxes, a return killer. A long-term buy-and-hold
        strategy means you’re not always focused on the market – unlike traders
        – so you can spend time doing things you love instead of being chained
        to watching the market all day.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Risks:</span>To succeed with this strategy,
        you’ll need to avoid the temptation to sell when the market gets rough.
        You’ll have to endure the market’s sometimes steep falls, and a 50
        percent or greater drop is possible, with individual stocks potentially
        falling even more. That’s easier said than done.
      </p>
      <h2 class="py-4">2. Buy index funds</h2>
      <p class="py-4">
        This strategy is all about finding an attractive stock index and then
        buying an index fund based on it. Two popular indexes are the Standard &
        Poor’s 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. Each has many of the market’s top
        stocks, giving you a well-diversified collection of investments, even if
        it’s the only investment you own. (This list of best index funds can get
        you started.) Rather than trying to beat the market, you simply own the
        market through the fund and get its returns.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Advantages:</span>Buying an index fund is a
        simple approach that can yield great results, especially when you pair
        it with a buy-and-hold mentality. Your return will be the weighted
        average of the index’s assets. And with a diversified portfolio, you’ll
        have lower risk than owning just a few stocks. Plus, you won’t have to
        analyze individual stocks to invest in, so it requires much less work,
        meaning you have time to spend on other fun things while your money
        works for you.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Risks:</span>Investing in stocks can be risky,
        but owning a diversified portfolio of stocks is considered a safer way
        to do it. But if you want to achieve the market’s long-term returns – an
        average of about 10 percent annually for the S&P 500 – you’ll need to
        hold on through the tough times and not sell. Also, because you’re
        buying a collection of stocks, you’ll get their average return, not the
        return of the hottest stocks. That said, most investors, even the pros,
        struggle to beat the indexes over time.
      </p>
      <h2 class="py-4">3. Index and a few</h2>
      <p class="py-4">
        The “index and a few” strategy is a way to use the index fund strategy
        and then add a few small positions to the portfolio. For example, you
        might have 94 percent of your money in index funds and 3 percent in each
        of Apple and Amazon if you think those companies are well-positioned for
        the long term. This is a good way for beginners to keep to a mostly
        lower-risk index strategy but add a little exposure to individual stocks
        that they like.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Advantages: </span>This strategy takes the best
        of the index fund strategy – lower risk, less work, good potential
        returns – and lets the more ambitious investors add a few positions. The
        individual positions can help beginners get their feet wet on analyzing
        and investing in stocks, while not costing too much if these investments
        don’t work out well.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Risks:</span>As long as the individual positions
        remain a relatively small portion of the portfolio, the risks here are
        mostly the same as buying the index. You’ll still tend to get around the
        market’s average return, unless you own a lot of really good or poor
        individual stocks. Of course, if you’re planning on taking positions in
        individual stocks, you’ll want to put the time and effort into
        understanding how to analyze them before you invest. Otherwise, your
        portfolio could take a hit.
      </p>

      <h2 class="py-4">4. Income investing</h2>
      <p class="py-4">
        Income investing is owning investments that produce cash payouts, often
        dividend stocks and bonds. Part of your return comes in the form of hard
        cash, which you can use for anything you want, or you can reinvest the
        payouts into more stocks and bonds. If you own income stocks, you could
        also still enjoy the benefits of capital gains in addition to the cash
        income. (Here are some top dividend ETFs and high-dividend stocks you
        may want to consider.)
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Advantages: </span>You can easily implement an
        income-investing strategy using index funds or other income-focused
        funds, so you don’t have to pick individual stocks and bonds here.
        Income investments tend to fluctuate less than other kinds of
        investments, and you have the safety of a regular cash payout from your
        investments. Plus, high-quality dividend stocks tend to increase their
        payouts over time, raising how much you get paid with no extra work on
        your part – making dividend investing one of the best passive income
        strategies.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Risks: </span>While lower risk than stocks
        generally, income stocks are still stocks, so they can fall, too. And if
        you’re investing in individual stocks, they can cut their dividends,
        even to zero, leaving you with no payout and a capital loss, as well.
        Bond yields aren’t always attractive and can sometimes be so low that
        they won’t outpace inflation, leaving investors with reduced purchasing
        power. Also, if you own bonds and dividend stocks in a regular brokerage
        account, you’ll have to pay taxes on the income, so you may want to hold
        these assets in a retirement account such as an IRA.
      </p>

      <h2 class="py-4">5. Dollar-cost averaging</h2>
      <p class="py-4">
        Dollar-cost averaging is the practice of adding money to your
        investments at regular intervals. For example, you may determine that
        you can invest $500 a month. So each month you put $500 to work,
        regardless of what the market is doing. Or maybe you add $125 each week
        instead. By regularly purchasing an investment, you’re spreading out
        your buy points.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Advantages: </span>y spreading out your buy
        points, you’re avoiding the risk of “timing the market,” meaning the
        risk of dumping all your money in at once. Dollar-cost averaging means
        you’ll get an average purchase price over time, ensuring that you’re not
        buying too high. Dollar-cost averaging is also good for helping to
        establish a regular investing discipline. Over time you’re likely to
        wind up with a larger portfolio, if only because you were disciplined in
        your approach.
      </p>
      <p class="py-2">
        <span class="font-bold">Risks:</span> While the consistent method of
        dollar-cost averaging helps you avoid going all-in at exactly the wrong
        time, it also means you won’t go all-in at exactly the right time. So
        you’re unlikely to end up with the highest possible returns on your
        investment.
